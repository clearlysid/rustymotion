# remotion-renderer-rs

A Rust-based renderer for Remotion projects.

For a project where I wanted to use Remotion, shipping a chromium/browser binary was not a very appealing idea. Instead I thought if I tinker around and see how the Remotion renderer works, I can maybe get it working "just enough" a little differently.
